# Machine learning prime number definition as classification problem

Could machine learning build a model for prime numbers?

When we think about a prime number we do it in terms of divisibility properties.

Wikipedia. A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.

I came in second place 🏆 in the #SapHanaCloud #MachineLearning #Challenge. 🤖
I wrote this blog about the challenge and the solution.

The classification stuck in my head for a while and then one day the prime number problem popped up. 💡

Machine learning doesn’t solve all problems, but it’s worth exploring if it can.

Lex Fridman post:

“Humans are an API to ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is an API to Python.

Python is an API to C.

C is an API to assembly.

Assembly is an API to binary.

Binary is an API to physics.

Physics is an API to the machine that runs the universe.

It’s computation all the way down.”

Can we express the prime number property as a classification problem?
